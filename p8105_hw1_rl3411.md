# Problem 1

## About the dataset

The `early_january_weather` dataset includes hourly meteorological data
for EWR, Newark Liberty International Airport, for the month of January
2013. This dataset has 15 variables (thus 15 columns) and 358 rows of
data. The variables given are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour, and the description of each variable are listed in the table
below.

The mean temperature is 39.6 $^\circ$F, and ranges from 24.1 $^\circ$F
to 57.9$^\circ$F, all to the nearest decimal. This dataset is mostly
complete, except `wind_dir` with 5 NAs, `wind_gust` with 308 NAs,
`pressure` with 38 NAs.
