# Problem 1

## About the dataset

The `early_january_weather` dataset includes hourly meteorological data
for EWR, Newark Liberty International Airport, for the month of January
2013. This dataset has 15 variables (thus 15 columns) and 358 rows of
data. The variables given are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour, and the description of each variable are listed in the table
below.

The mean temperature is 39.6 degrees, and ranges from 24.1 degrees to
57.9 degrees, all to the nearest decimal. This dataset is mostly
complete, except `wind_dir` with 5 NAs, `wind_gust` with 308 NAs,
`pressure` with 38 NAs.

| Variable name in dataset              | Description                                                |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `origin`                              | Weather station                                            |
| `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`        | Time of recording                                          |
| `temp`, `dewp`                        | Temperature and dewpoint in F                              |
| `humid`                               | Relative humidity                                          |
| `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust` | Wind direction (in degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph) |
| `precip`                              | Precipitation, in inches                                   |
| `pressure`                            | Sea level pressure in millibars                            |
| `visib`                               | Visibility in miles                                        |
| `time_hour`                           | Date and hour of the recording                             |

## Scatterplot: `temp` vs `time_hour`

Looking at the plot below, we see that the temperature was fluctuating
between hours, but showed a general positive trend through time,
indicating that it was getting warmer. The humidity was very high
between January 11 to January 14, suggesting a rainy period. After that,
the temperature peaked at almost 60 degrees before taking a dip down to
approximately 37 degrees.

``` r
weather_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = humid))
weather_plot

# Problem 2

## Create dataframe

Let us first create a dataframe.

``` r
prob2 <- tibble(
  rand_samp = rnorm(10, 0, 1),
  logical_vec = rand_samp > 0,
  char_vec = c('are','we','supposed','to','give','an','example','i','dont','know'),
  factor_vec = factor(c('yes','no','maybe','no','no','maybe','yes','no','yes','yes'))
)
```

## Calculating means

Now, we shall try to take the mean of each variable:

1.  We see that this works for `rand_samp`.

``` r
mean(pull(prob2, rand_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.1509342

2.  This also works for `logical_vec`.

``` r
mean(pull(prob2, logical_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

3.  However, taking the mean of the character variable `char_vec`
    returns a warning. This fails because we can only take means of
    numeric or logical variables, which `char_vec` is a character
    variable.

``` r
mean(pull(prob2, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

4.  Lastly, taking the mean of `factor_vec` gives the same warning as
    the previous character variable, as this is a factor variable.

``` r
mean(pull(prob2, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

## Conversion to numeric variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2, logical_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob2, factor_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob2, char_vec))
```

By applying `as.numeric` to those 3 variables, this converts
`logical_vec` to a series of binary numbers 0 or 1. 1 corresponds to
true and 0 corresponds to false. For the factor vector, it changes the
levels into numbers 1, 2 and 3. R automatically arranges the levels
alphabetically, therefore “**m**aybe” takes value 1, “**n**o” takes
value 2, and “**y**es” takes value 3. Lastly, we cannot convert the
character vector into numeric therefore it returns a series a NAs. We
can first make this into a factor then convert it to a numeric vector by
executing `as.numeric(factor(pull(prob2, char_vec)))`, but this just
assigns a number to the alphabetical arrangement of the elements so
taking the mean would not necessarily be useful. In general, we cannot
make calculations on non-numeric variables, thus `as.numeric()` allows
us to first convert variables into numeric then execute any necessary
calculations.
