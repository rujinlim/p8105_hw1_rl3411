# Problem 1

## About the dataset

The `early_january_weather` dataset includes hourly meteorological data for EWR, Newark Liberty International Airport, for the month of January 2013.  This dataset has `r ncol(early_january_weather)` variables (thus `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns) and `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows of data. The variables given are `r colnames(early_january_weather)`, and the description of each variable are listed in the table below.

The mean temperature is `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp),digits=1)` $^\circ$F, and ranges from `r round(min(early_january_weather$temp),digits=1)` $^\circ$F to `r round(max(early_january_weather$temp),digits=1)`$^\circ$F, all to the nearest decimal. This dataset is mostly complete, except `wind_dir` with 5 NAs, `wind_gust` with 308 NAs, `pressure` with 38 NAs.

| `pressure`                              | Sea level pressure in millibars                            |
| `visib`                                 | Visibility in miles                                        |
| `time_hour`                             | Date and hour of the recording                             |
  
## Scatterplot: `temp` vs `time_hour`

Looking at the plot below, we see that !DESCRIBE PLOT
```{r scatterplot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_point(aes(colour = humid))
```
